I am a 5th year PhD student in [Psychological & Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/people/graduate-students/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Marina Bedny](https://bednylab.com/).

I use neural and behavioral measures to study how human concepts change with experience, including sensory experience (e.g., congenital blindness, deafness), cognitive expertise, cultural experience, and development. I am particularly interested in applying theories of conceptual development to the cognitive neuroscience of concepts.

Prior to graduate school, I studied the neural basis of language at [MIT](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) and [NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/).
